summary: The Call for Music of the 21th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference
---



ISMIR 2020 announces an **international call for musical works** open to composers, technologists, and performers for selection and inclusion in the conference’s concert program.

Participants are warmly invited to submit pieces from **any musical genre** and in any style of electronic, acoustic, or mixed electroacoustic music that **explores the notion of music information** in the widest sense of the term. 
Contributors are encouraged to explore the use of AI-driven systems to improvise or play along with humans, generate or assist the process of composition, or to perform common music information retrieval tasks such as audio mosaicing, harmonization, intelligent looping, and others.

Submissions will be evaluated by the ISMIR2020 Music Program Committee and a panel of experts in music research chosen by the committee.




## Submission

The submission of musical works consists of:

- A two-page **description of the piece**, including the compositional process, performance requirements, and any aspects that the composer thinks are relevant for the ISMIR community.

- **Sound or video recording of the piece** as a link to an online resource.

Submissions of 15 or fewer minutes are preferred, however music of any length will be considered.

**Only one submission per composer will be accepted.**

The proposals will be submitted through the [ISMIR CMT system](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ISMIR2020) using the “Music track”. 
Templates for the description of the piece can be found in the ISMIR2020 repository: [ISMIR2020 Music submission templates](https://github.com/DDMAL/ISMIR-call-for-music/releases/download/v1.0/ISMIR2020.zip). 
Please note the submission proposal is for informative purposes for the selection and **will not** be included in the conference proceedings.

## Concert

The ISMIR 2020 Concert will be held on Tuesday, 13 October 2020 at the recently renovated Music Multimedia Room (MMR) of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT). 

The ISMIR 2020 Music Program committee will make its best efforts to meet the technical needs of the selected musical works but submitters are welcome to provide their own performers. 


## Registration

A **conference registration fee waiver for each accepted musical work will be granted to the composer of the piece**. 
In the case of a multi-authored piece, only one waiver will be granted.
